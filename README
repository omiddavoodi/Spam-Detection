This is a simple spam email detection python 3 module by Omid Davoodi, Iran University of Science and Technology as a project for AI class.
It classifies the emails using a variation of Perceptron algorithm.

This code is available under public domain.

Dataset is from http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/
You have to download the following files:

Spam Mail Dataset:
GP.tar

Normal Mail Dataset:
beck-s.tar
farmer-d.tar
kaminski-v.tar

dateset-cleaner1.py prepares the "spam" training data for the program. Currently only GP.tar is a spam dataset.

dateset-cleaner2.py prepares the "ham" training data for the program. Currently this includes beck-s.tar, farmer-d.tar and kaminski-v.tar.

sdvectorizer.py containts a function that converts a document into a multi-dimentional vector suitable for use in the classifier.

sdvectormul.py contains a function to calculate the dot product of two such vectors

sdlearner.py generates the knowledge base of the classifier

sddetector.py contains a function that classifies a new document using the existing knowledge base.

w.txt contains the processed knowledge base of the classifier, and is created by sdlearner.py
